# Code Documentation

## Overview

This Python script provides a utility to back up files from a source directory to a destination directory. The code uses the `os` module for file and directory operations and the `shutil` module for copying files. It ensures that all files in the source directory are copied to the destination directory, creating the destination directory if it does not exist.

---

## Modules Used
1. **`os`**: 
   - Handles file and directory path operations.
   - Functions used: 
     - `os.path.exists()`: Checks if a directory exists.
     - `os.makedirs()`: Creates a directory.
     - `os.listdir()`: Lists all files in the source directory.
     - `os.path.isfile()`: Checks if a path refers to a file.

2. **`shutil`**:
   - Provides file and directory management operations.
   - Function used: 
     - `shutil.copy()`: Copies a file from the source to the destination.

## Code Breakdown

### **Function: `backup_files(src_dir, dest_dir)`**
#### Purpose:
To back up all files from the source directory (`src_dir`) to the destination directory (`dest_dir`).

#### Steps:
1. **Check Destination Directory**:
   - If the destination directory does not exist, create it using `os.makedirs(dest_dir)`.
2. **Iterate Over Files in Source Directory**:
   - Use `os.listdir(src_dir)` to get a list of all items in the source directory.
   - Combine the source directory path and the file name using `os.path.join()` to get the full file path.
   - Use `os.path.isfile()` to ensure only files (not directories) are processed.
3. **Copy Files**:
   - Copy each file to the destination directory using `shutil.copy()`.
   - Print a confirmation message for each file copied.

---

### **Variables:**
1. `source`: The path to the source directory containing files to back up.
   - Example: `r"C:\Users\naveen kumar pandey\Desktop\PAPER_\TEST"`
2. `destination`: The path to the destination directory where files will be copied.
   - Example: `r"C:\Users\naveen kumar pandey\Desktop\PAPER_\TRY"`

---

### **Execution:**
1. The `backup_files` function is called with `source` and `destination` as arguments.
2. Files from the `source` directory are backed up to the `destination` directory.

---

## Example Output
For a file named `example.txt` in the source directory, the script will output:
```
Backed up example.txt to C:\Users\naveen kumar pandey\Desktop\PAPER_\TRY
```

---

## Key Notes:
1. **File Overwriting**:
   - If a file with the same name exists in the destination directory, it will be overwritten.
2. **Platform Compatibility**:
   - Paths use raw string (`r""`) to handle Windows-style paths with backslashes (`\`).

---

## Improvements:
- Add error handling for scenarios such as:
  - Source directory does not exist.
  - Permission issues during file copy.
- Log messages to a file instead of printing to the console.
- Enhance to handle nested directories.
